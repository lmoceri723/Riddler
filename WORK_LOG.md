| Aug 28 | 8:45-9:15am |                                 Implemented solutions for riddles one and two. Solution one was a ceasar cipher with a shift of 9, which we figured out by seeing if 3 letter words could correspond to "the". The second we guessed would be ASCII, and when I tried this solution it worked. |
| Aug 28  |  9:15-9:45  | Implemented solution for #3, played around with #4 with no success. The solution for #3 was that the chars were represented in binary ASCII values, just as I guessed. For #4, I tried to look into how the emojis were encoded, but I couldn't find any meaningful way to get data from them. |
